Another boilerplate to build assets without HTML-templates. Suits for projects, which have template system (e.g. Wordpress, Django, etc)

**It does**
— Builds styles with number of `postcss` plugins
— Builds scripts with `webpack` 
– Optimize images with `imagemin`
– Make svg-sprite with `gulp-svg-sprite`

**It doesn't**
— Does't build any HTML templates 
– Doesn't sync browsers or something like that

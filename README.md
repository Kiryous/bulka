Boilerplate to build CSS, JS and images (without HTML-templates). For projects with own template system (e.g. Wordpress, Django, etc)

**It does**
- Builds styles with number of `postcss` plugins
- Builds scripts with `webpack` 
- Optimize images with `imagemin`
- Make svg-sprite with `gulp-svg-sprite`

**It doesn't**
- Does't build any HTML templates 
- Doesn't sync browsers or something like that

**TODO**
- Better linters setup
- Prettier
- Fix svg opt

Inspired by initium and work of folks from codecode.ru
